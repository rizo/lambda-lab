# Expression Problem

This collection of exercices demonstrates different approaches of how to solve the [_Expression Problem_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem).

Currently there are solutions for Haskell and OCaml. If you with to contribute with a new language or improve the existing implementation just fork & make a pull request!
